### 5. [Vehicle Detection and Tracking](https://github.com/ZhuoyunZhong/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Projects/tree/master/P5-Vehicle-Detection-And-Tracking)
Use HOG and color histogram features extrated from vehicle and non-vehicle images to train a SVM classifier. Implement a sliding windows to find and use SVC to detect vehicle positions.

### 9. [PID Control](https://github.com/ZhuoyunZhong/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Projects/tree/master/P9-PID-Control)
A PID controller is implemented, which collects data and attempts to minimize the error (CTE in this case) over time by adjustment of a control variable u(t) (steering value in this case).

### 10. [Model Predictive Control](https://github.com/ZhuoyunZhong/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Projects/tree/master/P10-MPC)
A Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is implemented, which differs from PID control that is an optimized problem, but simulates different actuators input and predicts future vehicle trajectory in order to find the best trajectory with a minimum cost.

### 11. [Path Planning](https://github.com/ZhuoyunZhong/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Projects/tree/master/P11-Path-Planning)

In the project, a vehicle navigates safely around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. The path planner uses localization and sensor fusion data to generate a smooth and comfortable trajectory.
